## About us

[GMUM](https://gmum.net/) (Machine Learning Research Group) is a group at the Jagiellonian University working on various aspects of machine learning, and in particular deep learning - in both fundamental and applied settings. The group is led by prof. Jacek Tabor.

Some of the research directions our group pursues include:
- generative models: efficient training and sampling; inpainting; super-resolution,
- theoretical understanding of deep learning and optimization,
- natural language processing,
- drug design and cheminformatics,
- unsupervised learning and clustering,
- computer vision and medical image analysis.

We are hosting machine learning seminars that are open to the public. You can check the schedule on [our website](https://gmum.net/seminars.html) and join online (links posted on [our Facebook](http://facebook.com/gmum.net)).
You can also add seminar info to your [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZDJjcTFudnU0Y2UxNXNnODltdDc4Y3BtcTBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

## Environment Setup

Python will be used throughout the course. The environment setup steps are shown below:

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) following the instructions for your operating system.
2. Download this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gmum/mldd23.git`.
   - You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
3. Install environment from the YAML file: `conda env create -f environment.yml` (or `conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml` for the GPU version).

In the `environments` directory, you can find environment files with the exact versions of packages for each operating system (including a GPU environment for Windows).

_Important! If you would like to use your GPU to train neural networks, update the line `pytorch-cuda={cuda version}` in the `environment-gpu.yml` file. The current CUDA version is 11.7, but you should check your graphics card compatibility first._
