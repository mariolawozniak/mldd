    "# Protein deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Although proteins are more of an interest for bioinformaticians than for cheminformaticians, they are a crucial element of drug design. Especially the 3D structure of proteins is very important because of its connection to the functioning of these biological machines in the organism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protein representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are chemical compounds, but considering their huge volume, they are often processed in a different way than small molecules. Typical representations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Amino acid sequence** - proteins are strings of amino acids that can be represented as text, and by adding information about dihedral angles we can encode spatial information; we can process this representation using recurrent neural networks or transformers;\n",
    "![dihedrals](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Protein_backbone_PhiPsiOmega_drawing.jpg)\n",
    "2. **Graphs** - this representation is similar to molecular graphs known from the previous notebooks, but in this case to simplify the structure, only α carbons are represented encoding their amino acid residue; this representation can be processed using graph neural networks;\n",
    "3. **Voxel grids** - this representation is constructed by surrounding the protein with a voxel grid (cubes that encode atoms they intersect); usually the voxel size can be set to 1 Å^3 (1 Å = 10^-10 m); this representation can be processed using 3D convolutional neural networks;\n",
    "![voxel](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221347.g002&type=large)\n",
    "4. **Distance or contact maps** - two-dimensional representation that represents distances between alpha carbons; we can binarize these distances using a selected threshold value, and such maps are called contact maps; this representation can be processed using (2D) convolutional neural networks;\n",
    "![contact](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Protein_Contact_Map%2C_2-Color%2C_2QIP-A.png)\n",
    "5. **Point clouds** - sets of not connected points (alpha carbons) encoding selected features (e.g. amino acid codes); this representation can be processed by neural networks adapted to processing point clouds, which are similar to graph neural networks;\n",
    "6. **Meshes** - in this representation we only encode features of the protein surface; a graph is constructed by sampling a grid of points on the surface of proteins (a mesh), and the nodes can encode features related to the amino acids in the vicinity; this representation can be processed by graph neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems that can be solved\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inverse protein folding**, also known as protein design - a task that aims to find an amino acid sequence that folds to a given 3D structure;\n",
    "2. **Binding site detection** - discovering cavities in proteins that can be used as binding sites for ligands; it can be realized as 3D grid segmentation using 3D convolutions (e.g. U-Net);\n",
    "3. **Binding affinity prediction** - evaluation of the binding affinity given the ligand-protein complex (e.g. a ligand docked to the crystal structure of a protein).\n",
    "4. **protein-based *de novo* design** - designing new ligands that match the binding site of a given protein.\n",

    "**Exercise 1:** Implement one of the representations above (the code below can be used to implement 3D voxel grids).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zadanie 2:** Implement a network that processes this representation (you don't need to train it, it should only return a correct output). In the case of voxel grids: check if your voxel grid can be passed through a 3D convolution (imported from PyTorch), and the output shape is what you expected."
